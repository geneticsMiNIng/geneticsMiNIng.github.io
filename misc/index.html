    <p><a href="http://github.com/mi2-warsaw">The MI^2 group</a> (University of Warsaw and Warsaw University of Technology), led by Przemys≈Çaw Biecek, is looking for collaborators interested in machine learning methods and their applications in human genetics. These positions are parts of ,,MLGenSig: Machine Learning Methods for building the Integrated Genetic Signatures'' project funded by NCN program OPUS 11.
    </p>
    <p>The goal of the project is to develop machine learning tools to identify, understand and validate predictive genetic signatures (with applications in the oncology).
    Signatures are to be created based on extremely high-dimensional feature's set (~20 k for genes' expressions, ~200k for methylation, ~2M for SNPs). A lot of problems to be solved for programmers and data scientists.</p>
    <p>Techniques like model ensembles (stacking, boosting and bagging) deep representation learning are to be used to identify cross platform interactions (like methylation in promoters - expression of gene). Analyses will be performed mostly on data from projects: <a href="http://RTCGA.github.io/RTCGA/">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a> and <a href="http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/">Roadmap Epigenomics</a>. Analyses will be carried on in a close collaboration with oncologists and molecular biologists.
